# Life Expectancy Prediction Model

## Project Overview

**Objective**

Develop a robust model and prediction calculator to estimate life expectancy using various health and demographic indicators. This project leverages data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques to provide accurate life expectancy predictions.

**Key Components**

<U>Data Acquisition and Handling</u>

- Dataset: Utilizes 'Life Expectancy Data.csv', containing various health and demographic indicators.
- Data Cleaning: Ensures data completeness, handles null values, and corrects data types for accurate analysis.

<u>Feature Engineering</u>

- Variable Separation: Separates features from the target variable 'Life_expectancy'.
- Data Splitting: Splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing sets.

<u>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</u>

- Data Standardization: Cleans data and ensures consistency in country and region names.
- Correlation Analysis: Examines feature correlations with life expectancy to identify key influencing factors.

<u>Model Development</u>

- Model Selection: Develops an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to predict life expectancy.
- Feature Selection: Chooses features based on correlation and ethical considerations to avoid biases.
- Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using R-squared and RMSE metrics for accuracy and reliability.

<u>Life Expectancy Calculation Tools</u>

- Custom Error Handling: Defines an OptionError to manage invalid inputs in the prediction calculator.
- Interactive Calculators: Includes regular_calculator() and ethical_calculator() functions to compute life expectancy based on user inputs.
- User Guidance: Guides users through inputting parameters, applying data standardization and transformation techniques for accurate estimates.

**Methodology**

Follows a systematic approach from data acquisition and cleaning, through exploratory analysis and feature engineering, to model development and evaluation. Builds interactive calculators for personalized life expectancy estimates.

**Outcome**

Results in a comprehensive and interactive tool for predicting life expectancy. Combines statistical analysis with ethical considerations to provide reliable and unbiased estimates, aiding public health research and policy-making.

This project emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in understanding and improving global health outcomes.
